## Chris Mitchell

Hello there, i'm Chris.

I'm a junior full stack web developer, with an ear for the musical and a heart for the great outdoors. I'm an achiever driven by a sense of possibility and optimism.

With seven years experience as Performance Analyst at Brighton & Hove city council, I've project managed business planning, performance reporting and customer insight workstreams for high-profile services to the city.

With an eye on creating a future that inspires me and others, I'm looking for a web development role in an organised and diverse working environment that prizes strong leadership and clear communication; one that will enable me to create efficient and effective customer-focussed solutions driven by collaboration, innovation and object-oriented design principals.
