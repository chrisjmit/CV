I just finished a 12-week remote learning course at Makers Academy, a 'highly-selective bootcamp' that focusses on teaching the principles of software craftmanship and language-agnostic learning, and am in the exciting position of a career change into my first developer role where I am looking to continue to grow my passion for using code and design to solve problems, and applying behaviour and test-driven development, and the Agile and XP methodologies.
