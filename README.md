Hello, I'm Chris.

I'm a junior full stack web developer, with an ear for the musical and an eye for the great outdoors. I'm an achiever driven by a sense of possibility and appreciation for the moment.

With seven years experience as Performance Analyst at Brighton & Hove City Council, I've project managed business planning, performance reporting and customer insight workstreams for high-profile services to the city.

Moving forward, my aim is to create a future that inspires me and others, and I'm looking for a web development role in an organised and diverse working environment that prizes high-quality leadership and clear communication; one that will enable me to create efficient and effective customer-focussed solutions driven by collaboration, innovation and object-oriented design principals.

## Experience

As project manager in the Performance, Improvement and Programmes service area, I was business-partner to the Economy, Environment and Culture and Children's Services directorates.

I would lead and manage quarterly reporting of progress on KPI's and plans to the directorate management teams, and on the executive leadership team and local councillors at committee, to identify areas of delivery that were on-track, approaching target or off-track, and to clearly communicate the work being done toward improvement and achieving success in each area.

The role involved a support and challenge style, benefitting from an organised approach working back from deadlines, the ability to influence others, and a self-starting and positive attitude.
