## Chris Mitchell

Hello there, i'm Chris.

I'm a junior full stack web developer, with an ear for the musical and a eye for the great outdoors.

As a Performance Analyst at Brighton & Hove city council for the last seven years, I've project managed business planning, performance reporting and customer insight workstreams across high-profile services to the city.

With an eye on the progression of my skills and experience, and another on the future, I'm looking for a web development role in an organised and diverse environment with clear communication, that enables me to create efficient and effective customer-focussed web solutions based on collaboration, innovation and object-oriented design principals.
