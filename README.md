## Experience

*Performance Analyst*

As business-partner to the 'Economy, Environment and Culture' and 'Families, Children and Learning' directorates, I project managed the ongoing refresh of the business planning framework, worked with data leads and service managers to compile quarterly performance reports, and presented these to each of the Executive Director's Management teams.
This role required a support and challenge style, being able to clearly communicate detailed information to a range of audiences, a highly organised approach working back from deadlines, the ability to develop relationships and influence others, and a self-starting attitude.

#### Other key roles carried out during this time include:

- *Workstyles Business Change Manager*

Led the City Planning and Regeneration service management through a series of workshops to describe, design and challenge their current and future business model.

As author of the [Customer Insight report](https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/Customer%20Insight%20report%202014-2015.pdf), I co-ordinated the collection of transactional metrics from customer-facing services, publishing this in an annual report with an audience of senior management, staff and service users.

- *Internal Customer Survey Manager*

I co-ordinated the publishing, completion and analysis of an annual survey of staff satisfaction of those that work with and use other council services.
