Hello, I'm Chris.

I'm an experienced performance analyst and project manager-turned-software developer.

I'm driven by a strong appreciation for life, the arts and the natural world. I would love to make an impact by using technology for change, growth and innovation.

I just finished a 12-week remote learning course at Makers Academy, a 'selective bootcamp' that focusses on teaching the principles of software craftmanship and language-agnostic learning, and find myself in the exciting position of a career change into an area I find stimulating and satisfying.

As part of this, I wish to broaden my understanding and knowledge of dynamically and statically-typed languages, as well as grow my interests in object-oriented and functional programming, TDD/BDD, Agile and XP.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Javascript, Node.js, React, Express, Rails, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, HTML, jQuery, CSS, Bootstrap, Sinatra.
